# MakeCoin
<i>ACS 4991 Final Project</i>

This is a custom, full-stack distributed application for trading an NFT (ERC-721 token) that I minted. The code and design are based on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/droxey/shoutouts.eth) used for ACS 4991: Decentralized Apps & Distributed Protocols. The NFT that I minted pertains to naming rights for stars officially catalogued by NASA. Users can buy and sell these naming rights on this DApp. This project was built with Truffle and will be deployed to IPFS when the implementation is completed.

Here is an example of the front-end UI:
